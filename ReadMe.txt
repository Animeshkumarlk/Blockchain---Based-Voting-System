Blockchain Based Voting System

This project is a simple voting application built with Python, using a blockchain to record votes. 

It features:

- Blockchain Implementation: A basic blockchain model to securely record votes.
- Voting Interface: A Tkinter-based GUI allowing users to vote for candidates.
- Vote Counting: Displays the number of votes for each candidate.
- Blockchain Viewer: Shows the blockchain ledger of recorded votes.

The application demonstrates how blockchain technology can be used to enhance the integrity of voting systems. Feel free to explore and modify the code to fit your needs!

 Dependencies: `hashlib`, `time`, `tkinter`

 Run: Execute the script to launch the voting application.
